Fox News and NY times had the most negative Vader sentiment analysis.
The CBS News had a negative score of -0.15  verus Fox News with a positive score of 0.08. 
While both the FoxNews and NYtimes had an overall positive Vader scores BBCNews was netural with a 0.0!
The validity of the Vader analysis is questionable. There are tweets of negative events that have neutral Vader scores instead of expected negative Vader scores.
The Vader analysis on news organizations is highly dependent on the type of news happening on a particular day. A more fair analysis would be to analyze a larger sample of tweets over a larger period of time and look for patterns across a number of years.
